Dilemma
=======

### Introduction

This repo builds a webapp for playing Dire Dilemma. Built with gulp, bower. View dependencies in package.json or bower.json. This app is a simple demonstration of my coding skills & style, resulting in a small game. The game can and possibly will be expanded with several playmodes and extras.

### Disclaimer

My php skills are a bit rusty. I am well aware that the SQL statements are open to vulnerabilities. The point of this repo is to not build a stable, secure backend, but to build a functional demonstration. If you would like to improve this bit: be my guest!
