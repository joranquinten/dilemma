Dilemma
=======

### Introduction

This app is a simple demonstration of my coding skills & style, resulting in a small game. The game can and possibly will be expanded with several playmodes and extras.

# Dire Dilemma

First of all, a small introduction of the game. This game is based on _"[Dilemma op Dinsdag](http://dilemmaopdinsdag.nl)"_ ("Dilemma on Tuesday"), where you get presented with a choice each tuesday. No gray areas, no in betweens. You have to basically choose the lesser of two evils, such as _"Wearing wet socks all the time"_ or _"Whenever you make a typo, your PC shuts down immediately"_. Tough choices!
My take on this game is to spice it up a notch, by limiting the amount of time you get. Make your choice and make it fast!

## How to play

Once the game starts, you get presented with two dilemmas and a timer. You have limited time to make your choice, so choose wisely. When the time runs out, and you have not chosen, you get presented with another dilemma. If you did choose an option, you get presented with your choice and you can continue to the next dilemma.

## What to choose?

It is completely up to you. Prefer not being able to see to always have to crawl instead of walk? Your choice. We are not here to judge. (Ratings do get tracked, to figure out what is popular and what is not).


### Coming soon (of whenever)

#### Playmodes

I'd love to implement different playmodes! A few ideas:
- Multiscreen
*Mindreader* (or *The Great Zalazar*-mode): you'd have to guess what your teammate would pick)
- Group play
*Lemmings*: Several users play the game and get the same dilemmas to choose from. Democracy for the win: the choice with the most votes would be the result of each round.

#### Add new cards?

Currently, a pipe dream. It would be nice to be able to send in your very own dilemmas, wouldn't it? If you simply cannot wait until next years' release, drop me a line!

### Disclaimer

This repo builds a webapp for playing Dire Dilemma. Built with gulp, bower. View dependencies in package.json or bower.json. 

My php skills are a bit rusty. I am well aware that the SQL statements are open to vulnerabilities. The goal of this repo is to not build a stable, secure backend, but to build a functional demonstration based upon generated JSON content. If you would like to improve this bit: be my guest!

### To do:
- Performance check
- Save your choice in voting system and display result accordingly
- Present different dilemma than last shown
- Add playmodes (Solo, Party, Multiplayer)
